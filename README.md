I am currently a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/CCE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Lyles School of Civil and Construction Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Purdue University</a>, where I work in <a href="https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~jahansha/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Smart Informatix Laboratory</a> held by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rDHdOQIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Dr. Mohammad R. Jahanshahi</a>. My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and civil infrastructure, specifically focusing on computer vision, deep learning, generative AI, and structural health monitoring.

Prior to joining Purdue, I served as a Research Assistant in the Marce Lab at <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.tw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">National Taiwan University (NTU)</a>. I received my M.S. degree from the Computer-Aided Engineering Division at NTU, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jkEbHUEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Dr. Rih-Teng Wu</a>.
